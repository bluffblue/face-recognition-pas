![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/username/face-recognition-pascal/Build%20and%20Test)

A face recognition system implemented in Pascal, designed for educational purposes and learning computer vision concepts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This project is intended for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. It is not suitable for production use due to:
- Limited security features
- Incomplete error handling
- Lack of production-level testing
- Basic implementation of algorithms

## üéØ Features

- Face detection using dlib
- Feature extraction with ResNet
- Face recognition and matching
- Basic database management
- Training system
- Multiple face detection support

## üìã Requirements

- Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) 3.2.2 or higher
- OpenCV library
- dlib library
- ResNet model files

## üí° Usage Example

```
pascal
var
FaceSystem: TFaceRecognitionSystem;
Result: TRecognitionResult;
begin
FaceSystem := TFaceRecognitionSystem.Create;
try
FaceSystem.TrainModel('training_data/');
Result := FaceSystem.ProcessImage('test_image.jpg');
if Result.Recognized then
WriteLn('Person identified: ', Result.PersonData.Name);
finally
FaceSystem.Free;
end;
end;
```
